## Projects I'm Working On  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

*Private Repositories* --------------------

### **Automating the SDLC for Web Development with Agentic AI**  
ðŸ”¹  **Multi-Agentic workflow for Front-End Code Generation**  

ðŸ”¹ Uses Python, LangChain, and LangGraph to construct an large-scale agentic workflow

ðŸ”¹ This is my project as a current **Agentic AI Research Assistant** @ Florida Poly

### **Multi-Agentic Pipeline for Automatic Course Creation**  
ðŸ”¹  **9 Step Agentic Workflow for Educational Courses**  

ðŸ”¹ Once again, uses Python, LangChain, and LangGraph to construct an agentic workflow (Getting experienced with this)!

ðŸ”¹ Also incorporates Azure DevOps, Vector DBs, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

ðŸ”¹ This is a solo project as a current Spring 2025 **AI Engineering Intern** @ CEdge Inc

*Public Repositories* --------------------

### **FigmaGen**  
ðŸ”¹  **Custom Figma Plugin that Utilizes a Agentic AI for Component Creation**  

ðŸ”¹ Front-End uses **Typescript, Javascript, and HTML** for the Figma plugin development.

ðŸ”¹ Back-End uses **Python, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, and Uvicorn** for AI Agent and API creation.  

ðŸ”¹ Automatic Figma component creation based on custom user prompt.   

### **3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles**  
ðŸ”¹  **Point Cloud Data Processing for Autonomous Navigation**  

ðŸ”¹ Uses **KITTI Dataset, PyTorch, Open3D, and CUDA** for real-time object detection  

ðŸ”¹ Investigating **PointNet, BEV, and Voxel-based techniques**  

### **I have another really interesting full-scale project that I want to start developing soon!! I just need the time**
